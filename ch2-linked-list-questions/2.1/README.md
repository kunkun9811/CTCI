# Remove Duplicates in Linked List

### Important note

For one-way linked list questions. Whenever we have to decide an action of a node, we always make the decisions when we are still pointing to the previous node. This way, say for example deletion, we could stay on the previous node and change the previous node's next pointer to the next next node and delete the targetted node (which is the next node for the previous node).
